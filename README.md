# Google Automation with Python Certificate Projects
This is a collection of programming assignments I have completed for the Google Automation with Python Professional Certificate offered on Coursera.

#### Module 1 - Manipulating Images
The task was to transform and convert a directory of images in the following ways using the Python Pillow module:
- TIFF to JPEG
- Size 192x192 to 128x128
- Rotate 90 degrees clockwise

#### Module 2 - Processing and Uploading Text Files
Automated processing and uploading reviews from text files on a machine to a website. Opened each text file in a directory, added their contents to a dictionary, and uploaded each dictionary to a website using the Python requests module to send a POST request.
